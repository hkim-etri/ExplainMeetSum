            "The Main purpose of the meeting of ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley was to discuss the recent progress of it's members.",
            "This includes reports on the progress of the groups main digit recogniser project, with interest on voice-activity detectors and voiced/unvoiced detection, work on acoustic feature detection, and research into dealing with reverberation.",
            "There was also talk of comparing different recognition systems and training datasets, and a discussion of the pronunciation of the digit zero for the recording at the end of the meeting.",
            "In his next status report, me026 will summarise the work he has been researching.",
            "The digit recognition system is still not working well enough, they must get better results if they want to publish and be noticed.",
            "They have not really made many improvements, which may be due to their comparatively small training set, or the conditions the data is recorded under.",
            "The new VAD is quite a large network, and adds a delay to the process.",
            "This caused OGI to drop it, though speaker mn007 is assuming that a smaller and equally effective system can be developed.",
            "The alternative is to get yet another VAD form somewhere else, though it's not clear if they will even be required in the final system.",
            "There are some problems with the voiced/unvoiced feature detection, because some pitches are slipping through the filtering.",
            "The group have been comparing their recognition system to a few others, and theirs has not come off favourably.",
            "There could be many reasons for this, including smaller training set, more realistic data, or older technology.",
            "Speaker mn007 has put the best voice activity detector into the system, to great improvements along with designing new filters that run at the correct latency.",
            "Speaker fn002 has started to find parameters for voiced/unvoiced feature detection, and has found some classic ones, although there are other things she wishes to look at.",
            "Me013 offers a few ideas of simple things she may want to try, as he is not confident with everything she is trying.",
            "Speaker me006 is continuing with the idea of extending work on acoustic feature detection.",
            "He is continuing to read, and has discussed the suitability of factorial HMMs with a colleague.",
            "Speaker me026 has been learning more about previous work on reverberation, and is ready to start with a re-implementation of the theory.",
            "From there he wants to extend the work to look at time-varying reverb."
