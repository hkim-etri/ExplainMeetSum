            "After the costing, the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).",
            "The criteria used were look and feel (1), whether it is easy to find (1), whether it is easy to learn (2), use of LCD (3), speech recognition (7), trendiness (2).",
            "Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time).",
