            "Topics discussed by the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data, naming conventions for files, speaker identification tags, and encoding files with details about the recording.",
            "The group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the NSF's ITR (Information Technology Research) program, transcriptions, and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features.",
            "Particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures, i.e. how to deal with overlooked backchannels, and audible breaths.",
            "A small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read, uncorrected digits.",
            "A speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags.",
            "Sections of densely overlapping speech will require hand-checking so that overlooked backchannels may be manually segmented and labelled.",
            "The transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words, and not outside regions of continuous speech.",
            "It was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech, and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project.",
            "Speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting.",
            "During digits readings, subjects tend to chunk numbers together rather than reading each number separately.",
            "When working from the mixed channel, transcribers may select only one start and end time for overlapping speech, resulting in points of overlap that are less tightly tuned.",
            "Transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap.",
            "Speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech, as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked.",
            "Speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks, and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency.",
            "The encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming.",
            "The first test set of digits is complete and includes 4,000 lines, each comprising between 1-10 digits.",
            "New digits forms were distributed for eliciting different prosodic groupings of numbers.",
            "New naming conventions were discussed as means for facilitating the sorting process.",
            "Existing files will be changed so that all filenames are of equal length.",
            "Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags.",
            "Files will also contain information specifying channel, microphone, and broadcaster information.",
            "A proposal is being drafted for a grant from the NSF's ITR program for extending the research initiatives of the Meeting Recorder project.",
            "Speaker fe008 is performing channel-by-channel transcriptions to create tighter time bins.",
            "Tentative plans are to assign single channels to the transcriber pool and then piece them together afterwards.",
            "Efforts by speaker mn005 are in progress to detect speaker overlap in the mixed signal using harmonicity-related features.",
            "For determining the instantaneous frequency, speaker me013 recommended deriving the maxima from energy multiples of a given frequency.",
            "It was also suggested that speaker mn005 should determine whether portions of the signal are voiced or unvoiced, as voiced intervals reflecting a relatively low fraction of energy in the harmonic sequence are likely to indicate sections of overlap."
