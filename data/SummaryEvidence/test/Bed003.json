            "The group discussed the first version of the Bayes-net used to work out a user's intentions when asking for directions from a navigation device.",
            "Three intentions were identified: Vista (to view), Enter (to visit) and Tango (to approach).",
            "The structure of the belief-net comprises, firstly, a feature layer, which includes linguistic, discourse and world knowledge information that can be gleaned from the data.",
            "It is possible for these variables to form thematic clusters( eg \"entrance\", \"type of object\", \"verb\"), each one with a separate middle layer.",
            "These feed, in turn, into the main middle layer, that defines more general hidden variables, such as the tourist/business status of the user.",
            "The feature layer can end up being cue-based, while the middle layers task-based.",
            "The latter determine the final probability of each intention in the output layer.",
            "This first model of the belief-net was built in JavaBayes, since it is a free package, has a graphical interface, and it can take XML files as input.",
            "At this stage, all the actual probabilities are ad-hoc and hand-coded.",
            "However, there has been progress in the design and organisation of experiments, that will eventually provide data more useful and appropriate for this task.",
            "It is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output.",
            "This makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities.",
            "Another technique to systematise the work is the thematic clustering of the features, each cluster forming a Bayes-net of each own: for example features like \"admission fee\" and \"opening hours\" can feed into an intermediate \"entrance\" node connecting to the main middle layer.",
            "The next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters.",
            "Although, in theory, traditional AI plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions, the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task.",
            "Further work also includes discussing the possible advantages of Bayes-net packages, other than JavaBayes, with experts at ICSI.",
            "If they continue using JavaBayes, a script to help with the inputting of probabilities in the nodes is needed, as the in-built method is cumbersome.",
            "Finally, it was decided that at least some of the experiments designed for the new data collection initiative will factor in the intentions studied in the current task.",
            "The set of cues that form the feature nodes is not well-defined yet.",
            "Especially with lexical cues (verbs, modifiers etc), no one offered specific intuitions as to how they might contribute to the inference of intentions.",
            "Other features, like \"admission fee\", may be intuitively linked with one of the outputs (Enter), however, any probabilities are coded in an ad-hoc fashion and are by no means realistic.",
            "Cases like this, where feature and output seem to be linked directly, bring the necessity of a middle layer in the belief-net to question.",
            "Nevertheless, not having a middle layer would not allow for shifts in the discourse and would make the setting of probabilities and manipulation of the belief-net clumsy.",
            "Some issues with the use of JavaBayes also arose: the addition of new variables in an existing node overwrites all previous settings, and the native text file where the probability tables are set is not easy to read; this makes adding and changing variables and nodes problematic.",
            "Finally, it is unclear how much learning can be done on the created nets.",
            "There was a demonstration of the structure and the function of a toy version of the belief-net for the intentionality task.",
            "The features nodes include things like prosody, discourse, verb choice, \"landmark-iness\" of a building, time of day and whether the admission fee was discussed.",
            "The values these nodes take feed into the middle layer nodes identified as hidden variables of the user/device interaction, such as whether the user is on tour, running an errand or in a hurry.",
            "These, in turn, help infer whether the user wants to see, enter or simply approach a building.",
            "The set of features nodes is derived from linguistic cues, world knowledge and discourse history.",
            "SmartKom, although it does not code for intentions as specified in this task, provides a model of the discourse, which can be useful for the detection of features through querying and anaphora resolution.",
            "Experiments for the collection of new data will start soon, since someone who will recruit subjects and help run the experiments has already been hired and the designing of the experiments has also progressed significantly."
