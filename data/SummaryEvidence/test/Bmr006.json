            "Ongoing efforts by speaker mn005 to automatically  detect regions of speaker overlap were considered.",
            "It was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters, e.g. energy and harmonics-related features, to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker.",
            "Disk space issues were discussed.",
            "And, finally, the problem of speaker anonymization was explored.",
            "Recordings must be of existing meetings that are conducted in English.",
            "Participants should ideally consist of professors and doctoral students, but no undergraduate students, who are willing to record their meetings at ICSI.",
            "The Meeting Recorder corpus should comprise data from a large number of speakers representing different domains.",
            "Attempts should also be made to optimize the speaker population for generating good language models.",

            "A tentative decision was made to offer participants a recorded version of their meeting on a cd rom once the transcript screening phase is complete for that meeting.",
            "Non-native speakers with a low proficiency in English are problematic for language modelling.",
            "The prospect of creating another recording setup requires the elimination certain more complicated dimensions of the existing setup, e.g. the use of close-talking and far-field microphones.",
            "Speaker anonymization poses problems for the transcription proccess, and also discourse analysis, as it makes it more difficult to track who is speaking and to whom a particular utterance is being addressed.",
            "As the current version of transcriptions does not include speaker identification labels, no multiple speaker transcription conventions are in use.",
            "Research aims and corresponding concerns for future data collection were discussed.",

            "A total of 230 regions of overlapping speech have been manually transcribed for a subset of meeting data.",
            "Supervised clustering and neural networks are being considered as means for classifying overlap.",
            "It was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters, e.g. energy and harmonics-related features, to use the mixed signal to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker.",
            "Future work may also involve focussing on additional signals, and using a Markov model to analyze acoustic parameters over larger time frames.",
            "Beam-forming was suggested as an alternate method of detecting overlapping speech.",
            "Efforts are ongoing to select an optimal method for anonymizing speakers.",
